# 🧠 Age and Gender Detection using OpenCV DNN

This project uses **OpenCV’s Deep Neural Network (DNN)** module to detect human faces and predict their **age group** and **gender** from live webcam video or static images.  
It utilizes **pre-trained Caffe models** for both age and gender classification and a **deep learning-based face detector** from OpenCV.

## 📝 Description

With the growing use of computer vision in areas like security, analytics, and entertainment, being able to identify basic demographic information such as **age** and **gender** from facial features is an important capability.  

This project demonstrates how to:
- Detect human faces in real-time or from images  
- Apply deep learning models to estimate **age** and **gender**  
- Combine multiple pre-trained neural networks efficiently using **OpenCV’s DNN module**

The goal of this project is to **understand the integration of machine learning models with OpenCV** and to build an end-to-end mini AI system that runs entirely offline and in real time.
